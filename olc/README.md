# Obsidian Link Converter Plugin

## ðŸ“• Brief Explanation

This plugin helps you to scan all your links in the vault and convert them to `WikiLinks` or `Markdown` format. The plugin also helps you to convert final path to `relative`, `absolute` or `shortest possible`. You can do link and path conversion at the same time or separately. Adjust the plugin settings and enjoy converting your links in your Obsidian vault! 

## ðŸ“• Commands

Once the plugin is loaded, 4 different commands are added to the available commands:

These commands will help you to convert all links in your "Active File" or in all files in your "Vault" to the desired format.

## ðŸ“• Context Menu

Additionally, the plugin adds Link convert options to the `Context Menu` of `Markdown Files`:

In case you don't want `Context Menu` items, you can simply turn them off from the plugin settings.

The Context Menu item to convert all links to Shortest, Relative or Absolute path appears depending on plugin settings. Make sure that you adjust the settings depending on your preferences.

## ðŸ“• Final Link Format

You can also select the final format of the conversions as "Relative", "Absolute" or "Shortest Possible". Or you can simply select "Do not Change" to not make any changes to the final link formats.
